# GeoLink

GeoLink is a shared language for repositories that house geoscience metadata, science data, and publications related to the same people, projects, and activities
By talking to each other, we have a much better picture of our data in the context of geoscience. To achieve this, GeoLink partners are using Linked Data, a rapidly adopted, open source technology that sits on top of our content systems. Repositories can create RDF translations for different purposes and different communities.
